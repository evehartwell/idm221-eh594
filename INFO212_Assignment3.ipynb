        "## Question 4 [20 marks]: Download the dataset: `activity-data.csv` and load it into a data frame. The data set contains the time series outputs of a wearable clinical device measuring a patient's activities. Write code to answer the following questions:\n",
        "1. What is the total number of days covered by the dataset? Provide a list of all the distinct calendar dates on which recordings were made.\n",
        "2. Can you plot the number of steps against the recording 'Datetime', ensuring that each tick on the x-axis corresponds to a unique date in the dataset?\n",
        "3. Create a plot that shows the daily average number of steps in comparison with the steps recorded each minute. The plot should clearly differentiate between the daily mean and individual minute measurements.\n",
        "4. How does the average step count change during 15-minute intervals throughout the day? Compute and plot these averages across all days in the dataset.\n",
        "5. For each day represented in the dataset, what is the percentage of minutes without records (missing records)? Please calculate and present this data\n",
        "6. For minutes with missing data, fill in 'Steps', 'XCnt', 'YCnt', 'ZCnt', and 'Calories' using the mean values for those minutes across all days where data is available. Save the completed dataset to a DataFrame named `all_activity_df` with columns for 'Datetime', 'Steps', 'XCnt', 'YCnt', 'ZCnt', and 'Calories'.\n",
        "7. Could you create plots that illustrate the pairwise relationships between 'Steps', 'XCnt', 'YCnt', 'ZCnt', and 'Calories'? After analyzing these plots, what conclusions can you draw about the relationships and potential correlations between these variables?"
