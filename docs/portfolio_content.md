## The Center for Functional Fabrics
![alt text](.jpg) 

This is the work I have done for The Center for Functional Fabrics at the Pennsylvania Fabric Discovery Center.

The goal of this project was to optimize the Figma prototype of the manufacturing space tour and be able to display it live on the Center’s webpage. I spent time organizing, optimizing, brainstorming, and implementing new designs onto previous Figma work. I also wireframed and prototyped new designs, footage, and photography and used those assets to fully build new pages in Sitecore. 

My design process with Figma includes wireframing to user-tested designs. 
These frames are for an optimized animated interactive map. My goal was to reorganize files and enhance the quality of the animation with Figma tools. 

The Sitecore implementation included an extensive design process in which we looked to find the best way to translate the Figma design into a working website compatible with Sitecore.
I also worked on a Risk Matrix which was done after user testing to ensure that all deliverables were achieved efficiently.

These screenshots display the web iteration of my designs on Sitecore.
The video walkthrough shows one iteration of the final live website.

I worked on two Figma projects at the LeBow College of Business. One for the School of Economics page and another for the Undergraduate page. These two projects were dedicated to wireframing and implementing redesigned elements to organize the content in an evergreen fashion. My main goal was to utilize UI/UX practices to create an efficient and eye-catching flow of information.

I designed and prototyped an intuitive website for a local bank with InVision, incorporating UX/UI
tactics to enhance site features and create a seamless user experience. 
I created detailed wireframes of 8 pages and 19 frames in total, ensuring an accurate representation of the website's functionality and design.
