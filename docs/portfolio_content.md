## The Center for Functional Fabrics

In this project, I enhanced a Figma prototype for a virtual space tour and constructed a website to showcase the space's features.

The goal of this project was to optimize the Figma prototype of the manufacturing space tour and be able to display it live on the Center’s webpage. I spent time organizing, optimizing, brainstorming, and implementing new designs onto previous Figma work. I also wireframed and prototyped new designs, footage, and photography and used those assets to fully build new pages in Sitecore. 

My design process with Figma includes wireframing to user-tested designs. 
These frames are for an optimized animated interactive map. My goal was to reorganize files and enhance the quality of the animation with Figma tools. 

The Sitecore implementation included an extensive design process in which we looked to find the best way to translate the Figma design into a working website compatible with Sitecore.
I also worked on a Risk Matrix which was done after user testing to ensure that all deliverables were achieved efficiently.

These screenshots display the web iteration of my designs on Sitecore.
The video walkthrough shows one iteration of the final live website.

## LeBow College of Business

I worked on two Figma projects at the LeBow College of Business.
I designed and prototyped wireframes using Figma while collaborating with the marketing and communications team on a comprehensive brand campaign and website redesign.
These designs were crafted to ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes and aimed at enhancing the online presence and functionality of the college's websites.
The projects were dedicated to wireframing and implementing redesigned elements to organize the content in an evergreen fashion. My involvement extended to conducting thorough competitor research while incorporating UI/UX practices and advertising strategies to create an efficient and eye-catching flow of information.

## Audrey’s Hair Care Studio 

In my senior year of high school, I worked with a local hair studio to build a website from scratch. I designed, prototyped, and built a sophisticated, user-friendly website. I revamped an outdated and inefficient site by incorporating interactive Javascript-based applications for clients. Additionally, I dedicated over 20 hours to maintaining the site, ensuring constant content updates and debugging code to enhance overall usability. Throughout this process, I visualized and addressed client needs and concerns through effective negotiation and problem-solving.

## Bank Redesign

I designed and prototyped an intuitive website for a local bank with InVision.
This project incorporated UX/UI tactics to enhance site features of a local bank in order to improve the user experience. 
I created detailed wireframes of 8 pages and 19 frames in total. This comprehensive approach aimed to ensure an accurate representation of the website's functionality and design, laying the foundation for a user-friendly interface.
My proficiency extended to the use of Adobe Photoshop, where I designed high-quality assets and components. This design process was essential in maintaining consistency and visual appeal throughout the entirety of the website. 
Beyond the technical aspects, I actively engaged in user research, allowing me to propose a realistic user profile and customer base. This user-centric approach allowed me to tailor the design to meet the specific needs and preferences of the identified audience, further enhancing the overall effectiveness of the website.
