                    <h3>In this project, I enhanced a Figma prototype for a virtual space tour and constructed a website to showcase the space's features.</h3>
                    
                    <p>The goal of this project was to optimize the Figma prototype of the manufacturing space tour and be able to display it live on the Center’s webpage. 
                        I spent time organizing, optimizing, brainstorming, and implementing new designs onto previous Figma work. 
                        I also wireframed and prototyped new designs, footage, and photography and used those assets to fully build new pages in Sitecore.</p> 
                    <p>My design process with Figma includes wireframing to user-tested designs. 
                        These frames are for an optimized animated interactive map. My goal was to reorganize files and enhance the quality of the animation with Figma tools.</p>
                    <p>The Sitecore implementation included an extensive design process in which we looked to find the best way to translate the Figma design into a working website compatible with Sitecore.
                        I also worked on a Risk Matrix which was done after user testing to ensure that all deliverables were achieved efficiently.</p>
                    <p>These screenshots display the web iteration of my designs on Sitecore. The video walkthrough shows one iteration of the final live website.</p>

                    <h3>I worked on two Figma projects at the LeBow College of Business.</h3>

                    <p>I designed and prototyped wireframes using Figma while collaborating with the marketing and communications team on a comprehensive brand campaign and website redesign.
                        These designs were crafted to ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes and aimed at enhancing the online presence and functionality of the college's websites.</p>
                    <p>The projects were dedicated to wireframing and implementing redesigned elements to organize the content in an evergreen fashion. My involvement extended to conducting 
                        thorough competitor research while incorporating UI/UX practices and advertising strategies to create an efficient and eye-catching flow of information.</p>

                    <h3>I designed and prototyped an intuitive website for a local bank with InVision.</h3>

                    <p>This project incorporated UX/UI tactics to enhance site features of a local bank in order to improve the user experience. 
                        I created detailed wireframes of 8 pages and 19 frames in total. This comprehensive approach aimed to ensure an accurate representation of the website's functionality and design, 
                        laying the foundation for a user-friendly interface.</p>
                    <p>My proficiency extended to the use of Adobe Photoshop, where I designed high-quality assets and components. This design process was essential in maintaining consistency and visual appeal throughout the entirety of the website. 
                        Beyond the technical aspects, I actively engaged in user research, allowing me to propose a realistic user profile and customer base. This user-centric approach allowed me to tailor the design to meet 
                        the specific needs and preferences of the identified audience, further enhancing the overall effectiveness of the website.</p>

                    <p>I designed, prototyped, and built a sophisticated, user-friendly website. 
                        I revamped an outdated and inefficient site by incorporating interactive Javascript-based applications for clients.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I dedicated over 20 hours to maintaining the site, ensuring constant content updates and debugging code to enhance overall usability. 
                        Throughout this process, I visualized and addressed client needs and concerns through effective negotiation and problem-solving.</p>
